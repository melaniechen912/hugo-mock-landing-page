# hugo-mock-landing-page -> Spotify Landing Page
Melanie Chen (chenmel 21042266)

I reworked the example landing page to be a landing page for Spotify.

The 6 features I chose were:
- Playlist Creation and Customization
- Subscription Management
- Personalized Content and Recommendations
- Search and Discovery
- Social Interaction and Sharing
- User History and Customization

I made the general theme colors more of a green vibe to tie in with the Spotify logo's colors. I also altered the "Get Started" button colors to follow the green theme. I redirected the "Get Started" button to go to Spotify's official website. I also updated the "Contact" page info to encourage users to email me.
